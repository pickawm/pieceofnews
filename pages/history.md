# Collection History

This project began as a conference paper for the 2025 Eudora Welty International Conference in Jackson, Mississippi. That paper attempted to draw a line between Welty’s short story, “A Piece of News,” and Welty herself as a piece of news. 
The more articles and instances I found of Eudora Welty in digitized historical newspapers, the more interested I became in how newspapers influenced how readers came to Welty and her work, in how Welty was presented in newspapers in her time, and in how she was both the Eudora Welty in the newspaper and separate from that version of herself.
Below is an edited version of that conference paper.


## A Piece of News: Finding Eudora Welty in the Newspaper


*You have to set the stage for a story. You have to have something to identify it. I used to take all the county newspapers and read them all. That’s what got me interested in what went on in the state of Mississippi. Just the naked news.*
Eudora Welty, from More Conversations with Eudora Welty 


This project might begin with the question: Why? Why should we look for Eudora Welty in the newspaper?  Perhaps we are reluctant because we have an idea of what we will find when we search for Eudora Welty in the newspaper, in short: interviews, articles, reviews, and essays -- many of which are known and have been collected in *Occasions*, *Conversations and More Conversations with Eudora Welty*, *A Writer’s Eye*, *The Eye of the Story*, *Eudora Welty: The Contemporary Reviews*, and elsewhere. After browsing thousands and thousands of articles, across many, many newspapers and magazines, I can assure you that those are all there: the reviews, the essays, the interviews. It is all there. 
We return to the question: Why? Why look when we know what we will find? Because it is all there in its wonderful, original timelessness, waiting to be revisited. Because it is all there and there is so much more. Because this is how and where Eudora Welty found herself in the newspaper, and where the world first met and got to know her. 
While Welty scholars, especially Pearl McHaney and Peggy Whitman Prenshaw, have worked to collect many of the reviews of Welty’s work and interviews done with Welty, as well as the essays and reviews written by Welty that were published in major newspapers and magazines, as more and more of these and other periodicals are digitized and available to researchers, there is an opportunity to collect more, and to consider, and piece together a particular version of Welty’s life, as seen only in newspapers. For my project this includes: book reviews, essays, articles, interviews, advertisements, and so much more. I’m interested in these pieces of news as ephemera, as stamps of time and memory, in where and when Welty appears in newspapers and other periodicals, and in how she was presented to and known by readers in her time.



I first found Eudora Welty in the newspaper while working on a project related to V. S. Pritchett. In January of 1954, V. S. Pritchett wrote a review of *The Ponder Heart* - “Bossy Edna Earle Had a Word for Everything” - which is freely available to view on *The New York Times* website. I might have been satisfied with this reformatted version of Pritchett’s review had I not noticed the very tempting button at the top of the page - “archives.” I clicked it. 
I’ll note here that before I noticed that tempting button I had been thinking how it would be nice to see Pritchett’s review in newsprint, exactly how it looked in 1954. 
Here, again, you might be asking why? As close readers we want to stay close to the text, using digitized newspapers not only puts us as close to the text as we can be, it provides context, and maybe most importantly, it keeps us close to the texture, to that “rustle of surprise” that Ruby Fisher feels upon touching the newspaper. 
Looking at the two reviews, the reformatted version and the digitized version, side by side, I noted that while the text is identical, the context and texture of the digitized newspaper gives us more than the reformatted version. In this case, the bonus of a photo essay of Welty’s WPA era images, which there is no hint of in the reformatted review. And more generally, our senses are engaged with the digitized newspaper, we know the feel and smell of newsprint and are transported to January 10, 1954, so that we are both *readers of the past* and *reading the past*. 
Because of the surprise of the photo essay, I was tempted, again, to browse this digitized issue of the *New York Times Book Review* a bit. I flipped forward a few pages and stumbled on a splashy and dramatic advertisement for *The Ponder Heart*. Again, we have context and texture, and beyond that, a feel of how Welty was presented and marketed to readers.
I wondered what else I might find if I did a little more searching. Curiosity can have a swift and strong grip. Since that initial tempting button, I have browsed through thousands of articles across several collections: *The New York Times*, *The New Yorker*, *The Atlantic*, the Library of Congress, Newspaper Archive, Wisconsin’s Historical Newspapers, Newspapers.com, Genealogy Bank, and others. These resources are only the tip of the iceberg of the digitized historical publications that are available - never mind the many, many newspapers, on microfilm, and the periodicals, bound by year, and sitting on the shelves and in the basements of libraries waiting for researchers to give them new purpose. 
Researchers have the opportunity to find Eudora Welty in the newspaper as any reader might have during her time, while also looking for details that reveal Welty’s life and fictions in new ways, so that as much as digitized newspapers are a time capsule, they are also a telescope, allowing us to look back through time and find surprising visions of Eudora Welty. 
	In this way, this project rests on a concept familiar to all readers of Eudora Welty’s works - the hold and release of memory. 



New York City may be the center of the literary world in America, but Eudora Welty’s reach went well beyond the *New York Times*. It was when I began searching other newspapers that I began to understand *how much* I didn’t know what I didn’t know. As was the case in the *New York Times*, Welty shows up in theatre sections, television listings, arts pages, and of course the books pages. Following the reviews of Welty’s books as they filtered across the country is its own interesting project. Welty’s travels around the country giving readings and collecting honorary degrees and speaking at literary events were well documented by local newspapers and often include photographs. Finally, perhaps an unexpected place to find Eudora Welty in the newspaper is alongside pop culture icons of her time. 
One way we think of Welty might be as a *famous* author, but *celebrity* author feels like its own new category, yet another vision of Welty in her time. In this way, the more articles I look at, the more I understand that I’m seeing yet another side of Welty, different from the Welty in *One Writer’s Beginnings* and different still from the Welty Suzanne Marrs reveals in her biography of Welty. The Eudora Welty we find in the newspaper seems held in relief, abstract, as much a part of the news of the world as she is held separate from it, a view afforded us by that telescope of time. 
In her 1944 review of Virginia Woolf’s *The Haunted House and Other Stories*, Welty describes how Woolf infused her work by engaging the senses - “…the breath on the lips, the sound of the hour striking in the clock, the rippling texture of the surface in the moving air— they were the palpable shadows and colored reflections of the abstract world of the spirit, the matter that mirrored the reality.”
Historical newspapers and magazines, with their inherent wide narrative distance and palpability, are their own mirrors for reality, and offer a prismatic view of Welty, so many pieces of news across so many years scattered across so many columns of newsprint have a resounding orchestral effect, coming together here, bouncing off each other there. So that, at the discovery of each of these many pieces of news, one considers: Is this the *same* Eudora Welty? Or, better, *who* is this Eudora Welty? 
Unpacking these questions is at the heart of this project. 



As much as Welty was known to the world, there was a prevailing idea that she stuck close to home. Perhaps this is due to her being categorized as a southern writer, so that she was always placed in Jackson in public perception. Perhaps it is due to Welty being portrayed as a shy and private person. 
The life she presents in *One Writer’s Beginnings* doesn’t stray much from her family and home in Jackson. In her famous final sentences of *One Writer’s Beginnings*, Welty defends her sheltered life as much as she reclaims the idea of shelter -  from being protection from the world, to the *safekeeping* of one’s spirit:  “A sheltered life can be a daring life as well. For all serious daring starts from within.”
Yet her life as seen in historical newspapers and recounted in Suzanne Marrs’ biography, is a big life, exposed to the world, travel, television, theatre, awards. How to balance the sheltered Welty with the exposed Welty? Where do the two converge?
In her introduction to *One Time One Place*, Welty writes: “We come to terms as well as we can with our lifelong exposure to the world, and we use whatever devices we may need to survive. But eventually, of course, our knowledge depends upon the living relationship between what we see going on and ourselves. If exposure is essential, still more so is the reflection. Insight doesn’t happen often on the click of the moment, like a lucky snapshot, but comes in its own time and more slowly and from nowhere but within.”
When Eudora Welty found her name in the newspaper, what version of herself did she see? “What eye in the world did she feel looking in on her?”
Ruby Fisher, after reading the sentence with her name in the newspaper, says to herself: “That’s me,” — “softly, with deference, very formally.” It is her, but it is also a Ruby Fisher separate from her, one who has lived some other life, one who might die. It is the idea of the possibilities this other Ruby Fisher contains that mesmerizes Ruby, that “filled her with happiness”, tenderness, with a version of love. 
We can imagine Eudora Welty finding herself in the newspaper and having a similar reaction, one of quiet surprise, deference, one of love and separateness: *That’s me*, she might have said. *That’s me*, *that’s me*.
